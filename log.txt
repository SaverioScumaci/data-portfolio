Today I started working on Leetcode SQL problems. I was able to get through 5 questions today which I am happy about. I needed some assistance from ChatGPT on 4 of them,but now I understand how to do them, and could replicate the answers. It has been about two years since I last regularly used SQL so I will give myself some grace on not remembering
much at all. 

July 9th, 2025
Completed three more practice SQL problems in Leetcode. Mostly working on joins and nested queries. Again used ChatGPT and google to explain the questions I had, and to teach me more about these concepts. 

July 13th, 2025
Completed an additional Leetcode SQL question. Completed this time without any external assistance at all. 

July 15th, 2025
Finished the Leetcode question "Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee" and did the first 10 queries on the website SQL island.

July 17th, 2025 
Completed three more Leetcode SQL questions - Big Countries, Not Boring Movies, and Recyclable and Low Fat Products without any outside assistance from AI. Focused on filters and conditional logic.

July 22nd, 2025
Worked on three more Leetcode problems. Product Sales Analysis I, Fix Names in a Table, and Game Play Analysis I where I worked on using left, right, concat, upper, lower, group by, and order by. Felt good to get back into the swing of things.
