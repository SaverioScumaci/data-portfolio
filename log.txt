Today I started working on Leetcode SQL problems. I was able to get through 5 questions today which I am happy about. I needed some assistance from ChatGPT on 4 of them,
but now I understand how to do them, and could replicate the answers. It has been about two years since I last regularly used SQL so I will give myself some grace on not remembering
much at all.
