Today I started working on Leetcode SQL problems. I was able to get through 5 questions today which I am happy about. I needed some assistance from ChatGPT on 4 of them,
but now I understand how to do them, and could replicate the answers. It has been about two years since I last regularly used SQL so I will give myself some grace on not remembering
much at all.

Completed three more practice SQL problems in Leetcode. Mostly working on joins and nested queries. Again used ChatGPT and google to explain the questions I had, and to teach me more about these concepts.

Completed an additional leetcode SQL question. Completed this time without any external assistance at all.
